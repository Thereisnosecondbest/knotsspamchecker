# Bitcoin Knots Spam Filter Checker
This project is a Python-based Bitcoin Knots spam filter checker built using Streamlit. It allows users to input a raw Bitcoin transaction (tx_hex) and check whether it complies with the spam filter policies used in Bitcoin Knots. The checker verifies various conditions such as standard script types, fee rates, and dust outputs.
